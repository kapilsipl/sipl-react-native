# sipl-react-native

 This is a minimal setup for starting react-native application. 
 
 This setup includes redux, react-redux, redux-thunk, react-navigation and native base. 
 
 For fetching APIs - axios is used. Profile component is connected to redux.
 
 For authentication purpose, we have used SwitchNavigator. Please read the official docs for react-navigation for better understanding.
